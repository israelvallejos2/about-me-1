      <li>I was born and raised in the Los Angeles area with a close-knit family.  I remember as a kid looking at one of the magazines I'd get from the Scholastic book form that had a program written in it.  I would sit in front of the family Apple IIc and wonder what the heck the program was doing.  For some reason, I never asked my older brother if he could explain it to me.  It was, however, the first code I ever looked at.</li>
      <li>I have two bachelor's degrees.  The first is in English from University of California - Riverside (UCR).  The second is from California State University, Northridge in Manufacturing Systems Engineering.  I like to joke that I have two BS degrees.</li>
      <li>During each degree, I was exposed to several different languages through classes: Fortran 77, C++, and Assembly Language.  I really enjoyed learning Assembly.  At UCR even had a computer in my dorm room that had Linux installed that my friend ran a "talker" on it.  My friend helped me program a game of tic-tac-toe in C for the talker.  I also had a job working in the computer labs had been exposed to Macs, Windows, Linux, and Unix machines by that point.  (Remember Usenet?)</li>
      <li>Jobs that I have held have included teaching 8th grade English and manufacturing engineer.  I have now spent the last 15 years in manufacturing.  First I worked for Raytheon, now I work for Boeing.  Both of these jobs have included programming of some kind.  At Raytheon, I worked on robots that used a variant of C or C++.  Currently, I am working on automating time consuming, but repititious tasks my team does using a combination of VBA and Python.</li>
      <li>My goal is to eventually take the education from Code Fellows and turn it into a full-time job.  I enjoy puzzles of all sorts: Jigsaw, cryptic crosswords, escape rooms, and more.  (I've even created a few puzzles for a MicroSoft event called Puzzle Safari.)  Programming is very much like a puzzle to be solved and will bring me more fulfillment than my current work tasks that don't involve programming.</li>
